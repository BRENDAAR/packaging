Visual Studio 2010 solution for MythTv

The following files is a start at being able to compile mythbackend using Visual Studio 2010.  This undertaking was done solely to allow the VS2010 debugger to be used to develop for the backend.  I don't expect to have a completely running backend any time soon, I'm only planning on getting enough support working for the API Framework, Http Server re-write, & upnp development.
(others are free to continue my work to get a fully working system)

A few things to note:

  * So far, it can only compile the following projects:
        libmythbase
        libmythupnp
        libmythui
        libmyth
        libmythfreesurround
        libmythmetadata
        libmythsamplerate
        libmythsoundtouch
        libmythtv           * Not compiling clean yet.

        mythbackend         * compiles, but doesn't link yet (missing libs)

  * I'm using the 4.7.1 version of Qt for VS2008 which can be downloaded and
    installed from:  http://qt.nokia.com/downloads
              pick:  "Qt libraries 4.7.1 for Windows (VS 2008, 228 MB)"

  * You will need to edit the "mythtv.props" file to point the mythtv_source
    UserMacro at the location of the source code.

  * you may need to update the "Qt4VSPropertySheet.props" file to make sure the
    QTDIR value is set correctly

  * I tried to limit the impact to the base mythtv source, so I create any
    unix only header files that were included and they are located in the
    "compat" directory.

  * Any third party library that is needed has a directory under the
    "thirdparty" directory. You will need to look at each folder's README file
    to determine where/what is needed.

  * MythTv's version ffmpeg still needs to be compiled using MingW and import
    libraries need to be manually created (see README file).

I will hopefully get a copy of mythbackend (probably stripped of some features) running soon and will make sure to commit any changes needed to accomplish this goal.
