Visual Studio 2010 solution for MythTV

The following files are a start at being able to compile mythbackend using
Visual Studio 2010.  This undertaking was done solely to allow the VS2010
debugger to be used to develop for the backend.  I don't expect to have a
completely running backend any time soon, I'm only planning on getting
enough support working for the API Framework, HTTP Server re-write, & UPnP
development.  (others are free to continue my work to get a fully working
system)

A few things to note:

  * So far, it can only compile the following projects:
        libmythbase
        libmythupnp
        libmythui
        libmyth
        libmythfreesurround
        libmythmetadata
        libmythsamplerate
        libmythsoundtouch
        libmythtv           * Not compiling clean yet.
        mythbackend         * compiles, but doesn't link yet (missing libs)

  * I'm using the 4.7.2 version of Qt for VS2008 which can be downloaded and
    installed from: http://qt.nokia.com/downloads > LGPL Then choose Qt:
    Framework Only and download
    "Qt libraries 4.7.2 for Windows (VS 2008, 218 MB)"

NOTE:  Edit the following .props files _before_ opening the VS2010.sln file.

  * You will need to edit the "mythtv.props" file to point the mythtv_source
    UserMacro at the location of the source code.  Ensure that you specify the
    top-level of the hierarchy, meaning that there are subdirectories for
    mythplugins, mythtv, themestringtool, etc.

  * you will need to update the "Qt4VSPropertySheet.props" file to make sure
    the QTDIR value is set correctly.

  * Run version.vbs to create version.h, which is a file normally generated
    during the build process in Unix

  * The avconfig.h file is generated during the Linux configure, so move it
    to mythtv/external/FFmpeg/libavutil

  * I tried to limit the impact to the base MythTV source, so I create any
    unix-only header files that were included and they are located in the
    "compat" directory.

  * Any third party library that is needed has a directory under the
    "thirdparty" directory.  You will need to look at each folder's README
    file to determine where/what is needed.

  * Run copydll.vbs to move the .dll's from thirdparty into bin\debug.

  * MythTV's version of ffmpeg still needs to be compiled using MingW and
    import libraries need to be manually created (see README file).

I will hopefully get a copy of mythbackend (probably stripped of some
features) running soon and will make sure to commit any changes needed to
accomplish this goal.
